# decisionTree
The program must have Genes_relation.data, Genes_relation.test, keys.txt in the project folder
in order to run else it will throw file not found exception.

I ignored the dots at the end of each tuple entry in the data sets.

I compensated for that "." and for the missing white space in the keys.txt 
before checking the accuracy. 

The java program should run on its own. It will output a out.txt with the results when
inputing the test data set into the decision tree. It will also output a String representation
of the tree and the accuracy in the console.

The book algorithm definition of inducing a decision tree was used.
